2.ISSUE: Directive not enumerating scope.data variable sent from controller
	RESOLUTION: missing } at end of controller...no controller errors just no enumeration
3. ISSUE: table headers (and data rows) is displaying vertically
	ASSUMPTION: might be CSS...fitlered for just two keys and same results.

	RESOLUTION: 
		var ssData = data.map(function(d) { 
			return {
				Location: d.Location,

			}
		})
	**This also required that 2002: d[2002] be in brackets otherwise error for either unexpected number or undexpected string

14. ISSUE: page refresh iitially displays some code which is then either populated with data or left blank as in the 
           the case of a search box
    RESOLUTION: using claa="ng-cloak" on <div class="search ng-cloak">...css is display: none !important
15. ISSUE: Clicking on country code cell in table after it's been filtered changes it to Australia
	  RESOLUTION: 1) easier to add some logic\css to change pointer to default OR figure out why it's happening

Line Chart
1. ISSUE: Legend offset to right by what seems 40px and text cut off due to extedning past svg
	 RESOLUTION: width attr needed to be set to 550px
2. ISSUE: first g in svg is 811x479 which exceeds width of svg (700)

3. ISSUE: cl error: Invalid value for <g> attribute transform="translate(NaN,0)"
	 RESOLUTION: moved groups = svg.selectAll("g").data(dataset).enter().append("g") into linechart function
4. ISSUE: Responsive doesn't redraw the lines and data is being cut off. g component extends past svg
					@ 730px width data starts to be cut off.
					Responsive doesn't exapnd the line if the inital resolution is @730px. 
	 RESOLUTION: moved paths = groups.selectAll("path").data(function(d) { }) to linechart funciton
5. ISSUE: when filter applied additional <g class="x axis"> elements are added.  3 being the most seen when using P to filter

6. ISSUE: A second yaxis is being added after search filter used and line chart redrawn.  This must be 
					due to the redraw funtion.  
	 RESOLUTION: 
Additional: 


1. d3.filter not a valid function
